# TweetDeleter

This script helps you bulk delete your tweets.

## How to Use

1.  **Get your Twitter data:**
    *   Go to your Twitter/X settings and request your data archive.
    *   You will receive a `.zip` file. Extract it.
    *   Inside the `data` folder, you will find a `tweet.js` file.

2.  **Run the script:**
    *   Open your browser and go to `x.com`.
    *   Open the developer console (usually by pressing `F12`).
    *   Copy the entire content of the `delltweet.js` file from this repository.
    *   Paste the code into the console and press `Enter`.

3.  **Use the interface:**
    *   A control panel will appear on the screen.
    *   Click on "Select the tweet.js file" and choose the `tweet.js` file you downloaded.
    *   Choose a date to delete tweets before, or select "Delete ALL".
    *   Click "START".

**Disclaimer:** This is an irreversible action. Make sure to back up your data if you want to keep it.
